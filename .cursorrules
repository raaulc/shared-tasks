# Project Context
You are building a shared task management web app for a husband and wife. 
The goal is extreme simplicity and mobile-friendliness.

# Tech Stack
- Framework: Next.js 15+ (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Backend/Auth: Supabase
- Icons: Lucide React

# Shared Task Logic
- Use a single 'tasks' table in Supabase.
- Implement real-time subscriptions using supabase.channel() so updates sync instantly between two devices.
- All tasks must be associated with the user's email.

# UI Preferences
- Mobile-first design.
- Use clean, modern cards for tasks.
- Keep the 'Add Task' input fixed at the bottom for easy thumb access.

# Authentication
- Strictly use Google OAuth via Supabase.
- Implement a whitelist check: only allow 'rahulcode19@gmail.com' and 'riddhi.icct@gmail.com'.
